## Overview

**StoreFront** is a simple Java console application that simulates a basic online shopping system. It allows users to:

- Add products to a shopping cart
- Purchase items
- Cancel purchases (cart is saved, inventory remains unchanged)

This project is designed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
